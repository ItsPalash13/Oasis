Strong Points(Problems):-
Backlogs pile up quickly — missing just a few days leaves Ravi permanently behind.
No real feedback on progress — he solves questions but doesn’t know if he’s improving or just spinning his wheels.
Decision fatigue — he wastes hours deciding what to study next instead of actually studying.
Generic guidance from teachers — assignments are the same for everyone, even though students have different strengths and weaknesses.
No structured revision — he learns new topics but forgets old ones because there’s no built-in review system.
Low confidence from random practice — he feels like he’s working hard but still not exam-ready.
Strong Points(Solution):-
Backlogs pile up quickly → Guided learning tree with clear progression — Students always know exactly what to study next and can resume seamlessly after breaks.
No real feedback on progress → Performance analytics — Instant insights on accuracy, speed, and mastery at every topic level.
Decision fatigue → Structured progression (sections → units → levels → topics) — Removes guesswork by laying out a step-by-step learning path.
No structured revision → Built-in review cycles — Automatic revisits to old topics to reinforce memory before moving forward.
Low confidence from random practice → Gamified mastery system — XP, levels, and achievements make progress visible and build confidence over time.
