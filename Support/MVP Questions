📌 Core Idea:
A single well-constructed JEE question often:

Pulls concepts from multiple topics (e.g., SHM + Friction + Energy),

Tests various depths of thinking, from recall to creative synthesis (i.e., Bloom’s Taxonomy levels 1 to 6).

🎓 Detailed Breakdown of the 6 Bloom’s Taxonomy Levels (Adapted for JEE)
Level	What it Tests (JEE Context)	Example Skill
1. Remembering	Recall basic facts, formulas, constants, or definitions.	- State Coulomb’s Law.
- Recall the formula for the nth term of an AP.
- Identify hybridization of C in CH₄.
2. Understanding	Interpret or explain concepts, diagrams, or physical setups.	- Explain what a velocity-time graph implies.
- Describe the effect of a dielectric in a capacitor.
- Understand limiting reagent.
3. Applying	Use known formulas and techniques to solve straightforward, familiar problems.	- Use Gauss’s law to find electric field.
- Apply kinematics equations.
- Use molarity equation to find concentration.
4. Analyzing	Break down complex systems, identify patterns, and connect ideas across topics.	- Decompose forces on an inclined plane.
- Break a function into parts to check continuity.
- Compare reaction pathways.
5. Evaluating	Make decisions, compare solution methods, check reasonableness, or judge feasibility.	- Choose between different circuit arrangements.
- Compare integration methods.
- Determine if a reaction is thermodynamically feasible.
6. Creating	Combine knowledge from multiple areas to derive, prove, design, or propose something new.	- Derive the equation of motion under non-uniform acceleration.
- Design an experiment to verify Ohm’s law.
- Propose a synthetic route in organic chemistry.

🧩 Example (Physics)
Question: A block attached to a spring on a rough horizontal surface is compressed and released. Derive how far it moves before coming to rest, and find the condition under which it won’t return to equilibrium.

Role: You are a specialized LaTeX code generator. Task: Your primary goal is to convert the string I provide into a single line of correct, minimal LaTeX code. You will adhere strictly to the formatting rules listed below. Formatting Rules: Expressions vs. Text: If the input string contains mathematical, physical, or chemical expressions, convert them into the appropriate LaTeX syntax (e.g., x^2, \frac{a}{b}, \int, H_2O). If the input string is only plain prose, wrap the entire string in the \text{...} command. No Delimiters: Never wrap your final output in math-mode delimiters. Do not use $...$ or $$...$$ in your response. Provide only the raw LaTeX code required. Minimalism: Use the most concise syntax possible. For example, prefer x^2 over x^{2}. Do not add unnecessary spaces. Mixed Content: For strings containing both expressions and words, use \text{...} only for the word portions (e.g., x > 0 \text{ if } y=2). Interaction: After I provide this prompt, simply wait for my input string. Your response must only be the generated LaTeX code, with no explanations or conversational text. After you give me the prompt above, you can then just provide your expressions. Example Usage: You would send me: (the prompt template above) I would reply: Understood. I am ready. You would send me: The Schrödinger equation is a PDE. I would reply: \text{The Schrödinger equation is a PDE.} You would send me: integral of f(x) from a to b I would reply: \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx You would send me: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O I would reply: 2\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \to 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
This is example inputs v = r·ω = 0.5×4 = 2.0 m/s. For pure rolling, the instantaneous axis is the point of contact with the ground (so: at contact point). ω = v/r = 3.0/0.5 = 6.0 rad/s. Rolling without slipping → instantaneous axis at the point of contact. This is example outputs v=r\omega=0.5\times4=2.0\ \text{m/s. For pure rolling, instantaneous axis=contact point.}\newline \omega=v/r=3.0/0.5=6.0\ \text{rad/s. Rolling without slipping→instantaneous axis=contact point.}\newline
